FIRE EMBLEM BINARY, ENGLISH TRANSLATION
FEE3 2018 BUILD, 14/10/'18

Apply patch to a clean Japanese headered FE4 rom. Other patches can be provided upon request.
The patch is an IPS file. You can apply it with Lunar IPS, or you can just rename it to the same as your rom and it should patch automatically.
Patch and save tested on ZSNES and BSNES+. SNES9x has not been tested, but it should work fine there as well.
For the presentation, please load file 2 as I feel that shows off the game best from what I have translated. Don't forget to check inside the home castle!
Load File 1 if you feel like having a barbeque, and start a new game to get credits.
A more verbose variant of the credits will be posted below.
