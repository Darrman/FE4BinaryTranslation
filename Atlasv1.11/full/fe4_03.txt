Somebody what!? Who would do such a thing?[k]
[dcs]

[TWinTop]

Well, Lord Byron was always seen at Prince Kurth's side.[k]

There's suspicion that your father committed the murder.

What!? That's inconceivable![k]
[dcs]

[TWinTop]

There are all kinds of nasty rumours cropping up in Grandbell.[k]

[cs]
His Majesty's became so overwhelmed by it all that he's fallen terribly ill.

[TWinBtm]
//Sigurd
[Wait]<$10>
Kurth confided in my father for everything. What could my father gain from his death!?[k]

What about the two dukes who opposed the prince, Reptor and Langbart? I'd suspect them.[k]

[TWinTop]

I also thought so, but there's no evidence on either one of them.[k]

And the Reptor faction currently has control of the Royal Court.

I'm coming. By praying to Lord Blagi I've learned the truth behind what's been happening.[k]
