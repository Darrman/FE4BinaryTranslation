Lord Alvis, is it true that Sigurd's party is making an advance in Barhara's direction?

[TWinBtm]
//Arvis
[Wait]<$10>
Yes, but there is no need for alarm.[k]
[dcs]
Lord Langbart's army has already reached Lubeck. Subjugation of the insurgents should be forthcoming.[k]

Yes. Well, I'm not so sure I buy all this.[k]

Lord Byron assassinating Kurth, and Sigurd causing all this ruckus... I don't know.

[TWinBtm]
//Arvis
[Wait]<$10>
Your Majesty. Please, I'll explain once more.[k]
[dcs]
Lord Byron assassinated the prince with the help of Lord Ring of Jungby.[k]
[cs]
Duke Reptor and Duke Langbart both witnessed the entire horrible spectacle![k]
[cs]
The prince learned of their plot to usurp the throne, and that cost him his life.[k]
[cs]
Sir Sigurd is also without a doubt involved in the conspiracy.[k]
[cs]
Why else would he harbour the prince of a hostile country? Isaac no less.[k]
[cs]
These are clearly acts of treason against the kingdom.[k]
[cs]
The late Prince Kurth is also now a father-in-law to me... And for my beloved princess, Deirdre, I must put an end to Sigurd's path of destruction![k]
[cs]
If Lord Langbart cannot successfully subdue the rebels, Velthomer's fire knights, the Roten Ritter, will stop Sigurd's rebel army in their tracks![k]
[cs]

[TWinTop]
//Azmur
Well, you obviously have strong feelings about all this, and rightly so.[k]
[cs]
Alvis... (cough.. cough..) about Deirdre...

[cs]
I'm... wheeze... not long for this world, but you give me hope for the kingdom's future.[k]
[cs]
I don't know when or how Kurth could have acquired himself such a wonderful daughter, but the markings on your brow clearly identify you as a direct descendant of the Royal Family.[k]
[cs]
Where in heavens have you been living all this time?

[TWinBtm]

Ahh, forgive me. You've gone through more hardship than the lot of us.

[TWinBtm]
//Deirdre

[xChr][DlgCls]

[TWinBtm][DlgOpn]['Arvis' 0104]
She had no recollections from the moment we found her near the castle grounds.[k]
[dcs]
Aside from her name she doesn't remember a thing.[k]
[cs]
I was simply looking after her out of sympathy, but then I fell deeply in love with her.[k]
[cs]
With all due respect, I never in a million years would have suspected she was of royalty.[k]
[cs]

[TWinTop]
//Azmur
The day you brought her in to the Royal Palace to announce your wedding intentions, I tell you... I could have swore my eyes were playing tricks on me![k]
[cs]
I don't know. Call it a family's intuition, but somehow I knew. And sure enough under her circlet were the markings of Narga.[k]
[cs]
Lord Alvis, you understand what this all means, don't you?[k]
[cs]
According to the Book of Narga only descendants of Heim, like myself, can give off that kind of vibration.[k]
[cs]
And Narga's power is the only one capable of standing up to the Dark Lord Loputousu.

[TWinBtm]
//Arvis
[Wait]<$10>
Yes, I'm aware of that.[k]
[dcs]

[TWinTop]
//Azmur
Lord Narga's lineage through Saint Heim must not be allowed to perish! I want the two of you to bear a son as soon as possible![k]
[cs]
If the child inherits the power of Narga, he shall be Prince of Grandbell.[k]
[cs]
And once I pass on he'll become the King of Grandbell.[k]
[cs]
Lord Alvis, until the boy is old enough to rule, you shall be the provisional king. Do raise him well.[k]
[cs]
I hope you understand all of what I've told you. (cough.. Ah...ack..)[k]
