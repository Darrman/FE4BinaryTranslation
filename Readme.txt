FIRE EMBLEM: GENEALOGY OF THE HOLY WAR BINARY TRANSLATION PATCH, V0.7

This is a translation patch for FE Binary, a Japanese romhack of FE4 created by Habana887.bsRoNI. (henceforth "the Binary guy.") So, what does this thing translate?

TRANSLATED:
Unit names in general. Menu names are full, as are the dialogue calls for most people. Subs are truncated, though.
Enemy names are no longer shortened outside of character limit shortenings.
Item names. Character limit is in force, and they are abbreviated as a result.
Class names. These should be fine in all aspects.
Menus. This is still primarily a menu patch, and they should all be done. This includes the title menu.
Terrain names generally no longer truncated.
Army names are present. Sigur phase no more!
In combat system messages (eg: weapon breakages) are translated.
The promotion screen. No need to constantly refer to a let's play.

IT'S IN ENGLISH, BUT ROUGH:
Some castle names still have minor truncation, but the majority are fully spelled out.
Town commands (Things overlap a bit in some menus.)
Title screen (Hideous. But English.)
Title cards (Yeah, I know Ch1 is missing the 1.) Menu names are present but truncated due to space limitations.
The fortune teller. You can figure out who's in love with who, but some control codes got chopped off along the way.
Placeholder dialogue is present for the prologue. This gives way to gobbledegook in later chapters.

STILL IN JAPANESE:
The majority of the script. Perhaps in some farflung 1.0, this will be present. This is not 1.0.
All remaining castle services are entirely in Japanese.

SO HOW DO I PATCH THIS OLD THING?
Apply the patch to a vanilla Japanese rom. A HEADERED Japanese rom. The filesize is 4,194,816 bytes. If your rom has a byte count in the 300s at the end, that means it's unheadered. Which is bad. Go look up a tool that can add a header. (I used a dusty thing called SNESTool way back when. It's a DOS tool. Go get something fancier.) Don't forget to download Lunar IPS to patch the file! If you already have a Japanese copy of Binary, you can apply the "Jpn to Eng.ips" file. Should you already have an older version of the translation, apply the "0.5 to 0.7" patch to your rom. (0.51 should be compatible as well, what with it being one byte different. If you wanna use the UPS file, that's what NUPS is for. They're important!

ANYTHING ELSE?
If you wanna keep up with any shenagains I get up to, you can find it first at http://feuniverse.us/t/fire-emblem-4-binary-english-translation-v0-1/2487
And before anyone complains about names, she's Fury. Unfortunately, a bunch of data got shuffled around and I'm too lazy to find the pointers, so you won't be able to change her name to Erin. I apologise to any erinous players of this patch.
